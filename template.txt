7. REMUNERATION DETAILS:
   You MUST extract the following information:

   - Which remuneration option(s) are marked (checkbox ☒)
   - amount and currency next to the option
   - upper limit (if mentioned)
   - the remuneration table directly below the option (table must be extracted exactly as in the PDF)

   TABLE EXTRACTION RULE:
   ----------------------
   Convert the remuneration table into the following format:
     "rate_table": {
         "headers": ["Service", "Amount", "Unit", "Price per unit", "Total net", "Total brutto"],
         "rows": [
            ["value1", "value2", ...],
            ["value1", "value2", ...]
         ]
     }

   A table is considered EMPTY if:
   - ALL cells in ALL rows are empty strings, null, or missing.

   VALIDATION RULES:
   ------------------
   * OPTION 1: Fixed Price
       - Status = "Correct" ONLY if amount AND currency exist.
       - Otherwise status = "Missing".

   * OPTION 2: Remuneration Based on Time Expended (Rate Card)
       - Status = "Correct" if Attachment 3 contains rate values OR the extracted table contains at least one non-empty cell.
       - If the table is empty OR attachment has no rates → status = "Missing".

   * OPTION 3: Time Expended WITH UPPER LIMIT
       - Status = "Correct" ONLY if:
            • upper_limit amount exists,
            • currency exists,
            • AND the table is updated (at least ONE non-empty cell).
       - If table is empty OR upper limit missing → status = "Missing".

   * MULTIPLE OPTIONS:
       Validate each option independently and return each one inside `marked_options`.

   * MISSING SECTION:
       If no remuneration information is found → validation_status = "Missing".

   RETURN FIELDS INSIDE `remuneration_details`:
   --------------------------------------------
   For each marked option, return:
        "option": "",
        "amount": "",
        "currency": "",
        "upper_limit": "",
        "rate_card_status": "Present|Missing|N/A",
        "table_status": "Updated|Not updated|N/A"

   Additionally return:
        "rate_table": {headers, rows}
        "validation_status": "Correct|Mismatch|Missing"
        "validation_reason": "explanation"
