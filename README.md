### Introduction to Data Security

- #### Data security involves the process of protecting digital information from unauthorized access, corruption or theft throughout its lifecycle.
- #### Emphasize the CIA triad â€“ confidentiality(data privacy), integrity (accuracy and completeness), and Availability(data is accessible when needed).
- #### Security in data engineering encompasses various aspects, including data privacy, access control, encryption, data masking and compliance.


### Importance of Security in Data Engineering

- #### Protecting Sensitive Information: Ensuring the security of data is essential to protect customers, employees and the organization from data breaches and reputational damages.
- #### Regulatory Compliance: Adhering to data protection regulations (like GDPR,HIPAA, CCPA) is essential. 
- #### Preserving Data Integrity: Robust security measures are necessary to ensure the accuracy and consistency of data throughout the engineering pipeline.


### Best Practices in Data Security

- #### Audits and Assessments: Regularly perform security audits and vulnerability assessments to identify and mitigate potential threats.
- #### Data minimization: Only collect and store data necessary for the intended purpose and ensure proper data lifecycle management.
- #### Training : Implement employee training programs to raise awareness about security practices and policies.

### Data Security Technologies

- #### Encryption : Ensuring that data is unreadable to unauthorized users.
- #### Access Controls : Systems that restrict access to data based on user roles and permissions.
- #### Data Masking : Hide specific data within a database to protect sensitive information while maintaining operational functionality.
- #### Backup and Recovery : Systems that provide secure and recoverable copies of data, protecting against data loss or corruption.
